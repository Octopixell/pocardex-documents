# Pocardex Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 15, 2026**

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Pocardex ("**we**", "**us**", or "**our**") collects, uses, and protects information in the Pocardex mobile application (the "App").  
By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Data we collect

Pocardex collects minimal data to provide backup functionality and account display.

- **Google account profile info**: When you use "Sign in with Google" to connect Google Drive, Google shares your name and profile picture. These are displayed on the backup page to show which Google account is linked, and stored locally on your device only while the Drive connection remains active.
- **Google Drive data**: If you grant Drive permissions, Pocardex accesses only the files and metadata needed to upload, download, and manage the Pocardex backup file(s) stored in a **visible folder** in your Google Drive for easy access, download, and management of your local app data backups.
- **Device and technical data**: Device model, OS version, app version, and local diagnostics (crash reports, performance metrics) stored only on-device unless voluntarily shared.
- **Local app data**: Cards, collections, progress, settings, and linked Google account name/picture stored exclusively on-device using local storage. No cloud sync except explicit user-initiated Google Drive backups.

**We do not collect**: Email addresses, usage analytics, IP addresses, location data, contacts, photos, or any other personal data beyond Google profile info (name/picture) for account display and Drive backup authorization.

## 3. How we use data

- **Drive connection and backup**: Google Sign-In is used only to obtain authorization tokens to access Google Drive for backup/restore of your Pocardex local app data.
- **Account display**: Your Google account name and profile picture are shown on the backup page to confirm which account is linked. This data is stored locally on your device only and cleared when you disconnect Drive.
- **No separate app accounts**: Pocardex does not create user accounts, profiles, or persistent logins beyond the temporary Google authorization for Drive access and local display.
- **App functionality**: Local data enables core features like card collection and progress tracking.
- **Improvement and debugging**: On-device crash logs help fix bugs (never uploaded without consent).

## 4. Legal bases (EU/EEA users)

- **Contract**: Providing backup/restore functionality and account display you request.
- **Legitimate interests**: Local storage/display of Google profile info for secure Drive authorization confirmation and app security.
- **Consent**: Where required for optional features.

## 5. Data sharing and third parties

- **Google**: Sole third party. Google provides Sign-In and Drive API access. We share only the authorization request; Google does not share your password.
- **No other sharing**: No analytics providers, ad networks, or data brokers. **Pocardex does not sell your personal information.**
- **Legal**: Only if required by law to protect rights/safety.

## 6. Google API Limited Use Disclosure

**"Pocardex's use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements."**  
Google user data is used **exclusively** for backup/restore and local account display, **never** for advertising, analytics, or other purposes.

## 7. Data storage and security

- **Local-first**: All app data (local storage, preferences, Google name/picture) stored encrypted on-device.
- **Google Drive**: Backups stored in a **visible folder** in your personal Google Drive account under your full control. Pocardex has no servers or databases.
- **Security**: HTTPS encryption for API calls, OAuth2 for Google auth. Google profile data stored locally only while Drive is connected.
- **Retention**: Google profile info (name/picture) stored locally only while Drive connection active; cleared on disconnect. Backups persist in your visible Drive folder until you delete them.

## 8. User rights and choices

- **Simple controls**: Disconnect Google Drive anytime in-app (revokes access and clears local name/picture). Delete local data via app settings or uninstall. View/manage backups directly in your Google Drive visible folder.
- **Google controls**: Manage app permissions anytime in your Google account settings.
- **Deletion**: No data held server-side to delete. Local data (including Google name/picture) auto-deletes on uninstall or Drive disconnect.
- **Contact**: Email privacy@hyperdrivelabs.dev for questions.

## 9. Children's privacy

Pocardex is not directed to children under 13 (or applicable age). We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## 10. International data transfers

Google may process authorization data globally per their policies. Pocardex stores no data outside your device/Drive.

## 11. Changes to this policy

We may update this policy. Check "Last updated" date. Significant changes posted in-app.
